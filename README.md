AirSense: Real-Time Air Quality & Carbon Footprint Tracker
AirSense is a real-time air quality monitoring and carbon footprint tracker that helps users visualize and understand their environmental impact. The platform uses predictive models and user data to provide actionable insights and promote sustainable practices.

How It Works
User Data Collection: Users input daily activities (e.g., transportation modes, energy usage, waste production) into the system.

Air Quality Prediction: The system analyzes historical and real-time data (such as temperature, humidity, wind speed) to predict air quality trends using machine learning models like Random Forest and Linear Regression.

Carbon Footprint Calculation: The platform calculates the user's carbon footprint based on their daily activities, using supervised learning algorithms such as Decision Trees or KNN.

Real-Time Data Visualization: Air quality metrics and carbon footprint calculations are visualized in real-time using Plotly and Dash, providing interactive charts and graphs.

Insights and Recommendations: Users receive actionable recommendations (e.g., using public transport, reducing energy consumption) to help minimize their environmental impact.

Community Engagement: The platform creates groups of like-minded individuals to collaborate on sustainability efforts, track progress, and share tasks to reduce collective carbon footprints.
