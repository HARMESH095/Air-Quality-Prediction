## **✨ How It Works**

### 1. **User Data Collection** 📊
- Users input daily activities (e.g., transportation modes, energy usage, waste production) into the system.
  
### 2. **Air Quality Prediction** 🌫️
- The system analyzes historical and real-time data (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed) to predict air quality trends.
- **Machine Learning Models** used:
  - **Random Forest**
  - **Linear Regression**

### 3. **Carbon Footprint Calculation** 🌍
- Calculates the user's **carbon footprint** based on daily activities using:
  - **Decision Trees**
  - **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)**

### 4. **Real-Time Data Visualization** 📈
- Air quality metrics and carbon footprint calculations are visualized in **real-time** using:
  - **Plotly**
  - **Dash**

### 5. **Insights and Recommendations** 💡
- Offers **actionable recommendations** to minimize environmental impact (e.g., **using public transport**, **reducing energy consumption**).

### 6. **Community Engagement** 🤝
- Allows users to join **groups** of like-minded individuals, track progress, and collaborate on tasks to reduce collective carbon footprints.
